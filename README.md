  Carbon for React Native
</h1>

> The React Native implementation of the [Carbon Design System](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon)

This library is completely rewritten and not intended to be the replacement of the official [carbon-react-native](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-react-native).

It is still in development and far from publish released. Probably, it's only for personal usage.
