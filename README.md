  Carbon for React Native
</h1>

> This library is completely rewritten and not intended to be the replacement of the official [carbon-react-native](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-react-native)

> ⚠️ It is still in development

Build React Native apps with component and shared patterns using Carbon.

## Documentation
Visit [https://rakadoank.github.io/carbon-react-native](https://rakadoank.github.io/carbon-react-native) to see all the components, guides, and the utilities.
> ⚠️ This library is not fully documented yet, even the library is not finished yet

## Compatibility
This library is just a pure JavaScript in React Native and only depends on the primitive React Native components with [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg). It should compatible on platforms that React Native can support with those libraries. For the web only, [Carbon React](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com) is already there and do its best and solve a lot of accessibility feature, but you can still use this library for [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web)

> Currently incompatible for `react-native-windows` due to [react-native-reanimated issue#6386](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/discussions/6386#discussioncomment-10273839)
