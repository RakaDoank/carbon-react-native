> ⚠️ This library is not fully documented yet

## Compatibility

This library is just a pure JavaScript in React Native and only depends on the primitive React Native components with [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg). It should compatible on platforms that React Native can support with the [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg). For the web only, [Carbon React](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com) is already there and do its best and solve a lot of accessibility feature, but you can still use this library for [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web)
