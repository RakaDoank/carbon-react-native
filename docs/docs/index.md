# Carbon for React Native
Build React Native apps with component and shared patterns using Carbon.
> This library is completely rewritten and not intended to be the replacement of the official [carbon-react-native](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-react-native) community project.

It is still in active development, but it's not for production use yet. There are more changes will be expected later. Do not use in production until this library reach rc version and published on npm registry.

## Compatibility
This library is just a pure JavaScript usage in React Native and only depends on the primitive React Native components with [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg). It should compatible on all platforms available that can be built with React Native, but it is needed to be proven later. For the web only, [Carbon React](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com) is already there and do its best and solve a lot of accessibility feature.

## Getting Started
