# Carbon React Native

Build React Native apps with component and shared patterns using Carbon.

> This library is completely rewritten and not intended to be the replacement of the official [carbon-react-native](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-react-native)

> ⚠️ It is still in development

## Documentation
You can see all the components, guides, and utilities from the sidebar.
> ⚠️ This library is not fully documented yet

## Compatibility

This library is just a pure JavaScript/TypeScript in React Native and only depends on the primitive React Native components with [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) (for Android, iOS, macOS) and [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg). It should compatible on platforms that React Native can support with those libraries. For the web only, [Carbon React](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com) is already there and do its best and solve a lot of accessibility feature, but you can still use this library for [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web)

## Getting Started

Install this library in your React Native app. See [Installation](?path=/docs/guides-installation--installation) guide.
