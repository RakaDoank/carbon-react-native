## Peer Dependencies

Install these dependencies on your React Native project, (skip one of these library if already installed)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
- [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg)
- [@carbon/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons)
- [@carbon/icon-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icon-helpers)

## Fonts Installation
Install the `IBM Plex Sans` font to your React Native app. See the [Fonts Installation](?path=/docs/guides-fonts-installation--docs) guide

## React Initialization
This library depends with some React contexts like the color scheme to use the color tokens correctly based on the current color scheme. You have to wrap your whole React App once with `<CarbonReactNative>`
```tsx
// Somewhere like in your App.tsx file
import {
  CarbonReactNative,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CarbonReactNative>
      { /* the rest of your react */ }
    </CarbonReactNative>
  )
}
```
