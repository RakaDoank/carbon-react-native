```

pnpm install @audira/carbon-react-native @audira/carbon-react-native-elements
```

## Peer Dependencies

Install these dependencies on your React Native project, (skip one of these library if already installed)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
- [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg)
- [@carbon/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons)
- [@carbon/icon-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icon-helpers)

## Font Installation
Install the `IBM Plex Sans` font to your project with [react-native-asset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-asset). Update your `react-native.config.js` file (create it on your root project directory if doesn't exist)
```js
module.exports = {
  assets: [
    './node_modules/@audira/carbon-react-native/assets/fonts/',
  ],
}
```
Then, run `npx react-native-asset` to link the fonts

## Initialize
This library depends on React Context to use the color tokens correctly based on the current color scheme. You have to wrap your whole React App once with `<CarbonReactNative>`
```tsx
// Somewhere like in your App.tsx file
import {
  CarbonReactNative,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CarbonReactNative>
      { /* the rest of your react */ }
    </CarbonReactNative>
  )
}
```
