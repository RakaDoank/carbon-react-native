# CarbonStyleSheet

This module is similar as the React Native's StyleSheet. The difference is the module helps you to style the component with the correct color token based on the `colorScheme`, and the current breakpoint declaratively without implement manual conditional if-else, or key-value pairs of the current `colorScheme` and the current breakpoint.

```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native'
import {
  CarbonStyleSheet,
  Text,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export function YourComponent() {
  CarbonStyleSheet.use() // Keep your components reactive on `colorScheme` and breakpoint change

  return (
    <View
      style={ styleSheet.container }
    >
      <View>
        <Text style={ styleSheet.text }>
          First Text
        </Text>
      </View>

      <View>
        <Text style={ styleSheet.text }>
          Second Text
        </Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  )
}

const styleSheet = CarbonStyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    gap: 8,
    [CarbonStyleSheet.breakpoint.small]: {
      // For `small` breakpoint, it will has this style
      flexDirection: 'column',
    },
    [CarbonStyleSheet.breakpoint.medium]: {
      // For the 'medium' breakpoint and larger breakpoint, it will has this style
      flexDirection: 'row',
    },
  },
  text: {
    // In `gray_10` scheme, it will be colored with `#161616`
    // In `gray_100` scheme, it will be colored with `#f4f4f4`
    // You can check `text_primary` color at `Color.Token.gray_10.text_primary` and `Color.Token.gray_100.text_primary`
    color: CarbonStyleSheet.color.text_primary,
  },
})

```

## Explanation

This module is iterating all your style class name and its properties to check if it contains Carbon color token key, and breakpoint key, and then add other static styles internally regarding the color schemes and breakpoints. It will returns with [getter property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) with your own property name to check what is the current color scheme and the current breakpoint through global scope variable before it returns its value with a help of React hook to notify your components that color scheme or breakpoint or both have been changed.
