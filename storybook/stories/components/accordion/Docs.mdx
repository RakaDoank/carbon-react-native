# Accordion

Accordion is a group of vertically list of headers that can reveal or hide associated sections of content. You can use accordion by using `Accordion` as parent, and `Accordion.Item` as children.

```tsx
import {
  Accordion,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export default function Component() {

  return (
    <Accordion
      size="medium"
      flushAlignment={ false }
    >
      <Accordion.Item
        title="Item 1 Title"
        defaultOpen // let open by default
      >
        {/* your content */}
      </Accordion.Item>

      <Accordion.Item
        title="Item 2 Title"
      >
        { /* your content */ }
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
  )

}
```
