# Radio Button

Radiobutton component is a composed component of [RadioButtonInput](?path=/docs/radio-button-input--docs) and FormLabel

```tsx
import {
  RadioButton,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export default function Component() {
  return (
    <RadioButton
      value="bbc"
      label="Radio Label"
    />
  )
}
```

<Canvas
  of={ RadioButton.RadioButton }
/>

<Controls
  of={ RadioButton.RadioButton }
/>

## Caveat
In common usage, radio button usually represent a group of mutually exclusive choices, compared to checkboxes that user is able to select one or more.

Probably you only need [`RadioButtonGroup`](./index.md) instead of manually building group of radio buttons.

## Props
