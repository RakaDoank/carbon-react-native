# Installation

Install these libraries to your project

npm
```
npm install @audira/carbon-react-native @audira/carbon-react-native-elements
```

pnpm
```
pnpm install @audira/carbon-react-native @audira/carbon-react-native-elements
```

yarn
```
yarn add @audira/carbon-react-native @audira/carbon-react-native-elements
```

## Peer Dependencies

Install these dependencies on your React Native project, (skip one of these library if already installed)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) (Only for Android, iOS, and macOS. Windows and Web are using [Animated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) API of React Native)
- [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg)
- [@carbon/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons)
- [@carbon/icon-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icon-helpers) (Only if you want to use `<Icon>` component)

## Fonts Installation

Install the `IBM Plex Sans` font to your React Native app.

See the [Fonts](?path=/docs/guides-installation-fonts--docs) installation guide.

## SVG Transformer

This component library relies on transformed SVG files of `@carbon/icons` in [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg) markup internally, e.g. the checkmark icon for the `Checkbox` component, chevron icon for the `Accordion` component, etc.

See [SVG Transformer](?path=/docs/guides-installation-svg-transformer--svg-transformer) guide.

## React Initialization
This library depends with some React contexts like the color scheme to use the color tokens correctly based on the current color scheme. You have to wrap your whole React App once with `<CarbonReactNative>`
```tsx
// Somewhere like in your App.tsx file
import {
  CarbonReactNative,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CarbonReactNative>
      { /* the rest of your react */ }
    </CarbonReactNative>
  )
}
```
