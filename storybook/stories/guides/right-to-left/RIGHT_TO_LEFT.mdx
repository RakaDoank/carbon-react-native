# Right-to-Left (RTL)

Over 2 billion people read and write in right-to-left (RTL) languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi and Urdu. Layouts should support both left-to-right (LTR) and RTL languages through mirroring and other best practices to ensure content is easy for global audiences to understand and navigate.

Not only the text, it also affects how the component renders.

<Stories/>

## Configuration

Similar to the [Change Color Scheme](?path=/docs/guides-change-color-scheme--docs), to use the RTL, give the `rtl` prop with `true` value to the `<CarbonReactNative>`

```tsx
import {
  CarbonReactNative,
} from '@audira/carbon-react-native'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CarbonReactNative
      rtl
    >
      { /* the rest of your react */ }
    </CarbonReactNative>
  )
}
```

> Be aware of updating a React state in the root tree. It may causes unresponsive JavaScript thread. Refer to the React Native performance docs at [https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#js-frame-rate-javascript-thread](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#js-frame-rate-javascript-thread)

### Replace `View` with `Box`

The global `rtl` prop in the `CarbonReactNative` only works for the carbon components, not your views. To match your views direction with carbon components, replace your `View` with `Box`

```tsx
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  type BoxProps, // same as `ViewProps` from RN
  type BoxRef, // same as `View` from RN
} from "@audira/carbon-react-native"

export default function Component() {
  return (
    // <View>
    <Box>
      <Button.Primary text="foo"/>
      <Box>
        { /* other nested elements */}
      </Box>
    </Box>
    // </View>
  )
}
```

This component is just a basic View to help you set [the `dir` prop for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/localization/#localization-props), and direction style for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows automatically. This is a good case if your app has multiple localizations. On the other hand, the props and ref are exactly same as the `View` from React Native. You can see the [Box.tsx](https://github.com/RakaDoank/carbon-react-native/blob/main/packages/carbon-react-native/src/components/box/Box.tsx) source code.

### Caveat
If you really don't want to use the `Box`, you have to set your own View with correct `dir` prop value

```tsx
import {
  StyleSheet,
  View,
} from "react-native"

export default function Component() {

  return (
    <View
      dir="rtl" // here, you have to set manually for Web
      style={ styleSheet.view }
    >
      { /* other elements */ }
    </View>
  )

}

const styleSheet = StyleSheet.create({
  view: {
    direction: "rtl",
  },
})
```
