# Right-to-Left (RTL)

Over 2 billion people read and write in right-to-left (RTL) languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi and Urdu. Layouts should support both left-to-right (LTR) and RTL languages through mirroring and other best practices to ensure content is easy for global audiences to understand and navigate.

Not only the text, it also affects how the component renders.

<Stories/>

## Configuration

Similar to the [Change Color Scheme](?path=/docs/guides-change-color-scheme--docs), to use the RTL, give the `rtl` prop with `true` value to the `<CarbonReactNative>`

```tsx
import {
  CarbonReactNative,
} from '@rakadoank/carbon-react-native'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CarbonReactNative
      rtl
    >
      { /* the rest of your react */ }
    </CarbonReactNative>
  )
}
```

> Be aware of updating a React state in the root tree. It may causes unresponsive JavaScript thread. Refer to the React Native performance docs at [https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#js-frame-rate-javascript-thread](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#js-frame-rate-javascript-thread)
